# üìâ Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction Using EDA  

Welcome to my **Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction** project!  
This guided project provided me with the opportunity to explore how data analytics can help businesses address critical challenges.  

Using **Jupyter Notebook** and various **Python libraries**, I analyzed telecom company data to uncover patterns in customer behavior and predict churn rates. Special thanks to the **WsCube Tech YouTube channel** for guiding me through this insightful journey.

## üåü Project Overview  

The telecom industry often faces challenges related to customer churn, which directly impacts revenue and growth.  
This project focuses on analyzing the factors contributing to churn and predicting the likelihood of a customer leaving.  

### Project Objectives:  
- **Understand Customer Behavior**: Explore customer demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant factors.  
- **Identify Key Drivers of Churn**: Analyze the reasons behind customer churn.  
- **Build Actionable Insights**: Provide recommendations to reduce churn rates.  

Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques, I transformed raw data into meaningful insights that can drive strategic decision-making.
